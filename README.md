# 3. Running the plugin using local data
A usage example of running the graph modeller is shown below:

</p>
In this example, it is a straight forward exercise, where the user will deal with data locally and conduct a routine assessment.

# 4. Running the plugin using db data

</p>
The data are exported from a local directory to a database, then the db data are then exported into QGIS for further calculations.
Unlike using the local data, here, the user have the possiblity to export data as shown in the below example, 
but also to import data directly (this feature is not released, can be done on demand).

# 5. Feature releases:
  - Run Interpreter:  This is an extra feature in which the user can plot the general trend of the impact assessment.
  - to be filled
# 6. Remarks:
- This demo is very useful for monitoring projects. Here we present the impact assessment linear features such as roads, railways and so on the different birds habitats.
- It is a project which has the potential of being adapted to your needs. Feel free to touch base or contact michel.nzikou@alumni.uleth.ca.
